* vdebugger

** Description

This is a debugger for linux programs. It should work on programs compiled for linux with a dwarf file.

I use nix for reproducibility. You can use my flake file for developpement purpose or to automatically compiled the application.


** Installation

This is a classic rust project. You can compile it having the rust compiler like so :

```bash
cargo build --release
```

The binary will be in the target/release folder.

If you are a nix user you can use the command

```bash
nix build
```
to obtain the same result.

You can also use the command

```bash
nix develop
```
to obtain a shell with all the dependencies installed that will get you ready for developping the project in the same environment like me.


** How to use

The project works like a classic debugger like gdb. You should compile your project with debugging symbols then, run :

```bash
vdebugger <your_program>
```

to start debugging.
